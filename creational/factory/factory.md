The factory design pattern is a creational design pattern that provides a way to create objects without explicitly specifying the class to be instantiated. It acts like a factory that manufactures different products (objects) based on the request.

Here's a breakdown of the concept:

## Components:

- Factory Class: This class acts as the central point for object creation. It defines a method (often called create or getProduct) that takes input (e.g., a type identifier) and returns an instance of the appropriate subclass.

- Product Interface (or Abstract Class): This defines the common interface or base class for all the objects the factory can create. It specifies the methods that all products must implement.

- Concrete Product Classes: These are the actual classes that implement the product interface and represent the specific objects that can be created. They extend the product interface and provide their own implementations for the defined methods.

## Benefits:

- Loose Coupling: The code that uses the factory doesn't need to know about the specific concrete product classes. It just interacts with the product interface. This makes the code more flexible and easier to maintain.

- Centralized Control: The factory class encapsulates the logic for object creation. You can easily add new product types by creating new concrete product classes without modifying the existing code that uses the factory.

- Flexibility: You can decide at runtime which type of object to create based on some condition.
